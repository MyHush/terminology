# Hush Terminology Learns You Good!

## Autoshielding

A feature where Hush wallets will automatically send funds to a zaddr from transparent addresses, on first use.
This protects funds, giving them privacy, without users needing to understand why or do the operation themselves.

## coinbase

The technical term for newly mined coins, which have no transaction history.

## DPoW

Delayed-Proof-of-Work, which protects HUSH with the hashrate security of Bitcoin.

## HIP

Hush Improvement Proposal [hips](https://github.com/myhush/hips)


## hushd

The main "full node" of hush. Downloads the full blockchain which is currently a few GB :)

## HushChat

A new "chat GUI" encrypted messenger interface to Hush wallets.

## ITM Attack

A shielded address linkability metadata leakage attack

## Komodo (KMD)

The very first Zcash Protocol genesis block to be mined, before ZEC mainnet launched.

## mainnet

The production network of a blockchain, as opposed to a testnet. It is similar to the `master` branch in Git.

## Metaverse Metadata Attack

The concept of simulating the history of a blockchain to make it leak metadata via
consensus oracle attack.

## Sapling

The latest generation of shielded addresses (zaddrs) which are fast and have many provable guarantees about certain potential bugs existing.

## Sapling Consolidation

An advanced feature originally developed by ZER which was ported to HUSH and improved in various ways, such as by adding Sietch support and reducing
metadata leakage. It actively "consolidates" many ZUTXOs into single and hence more efficient-to-spend ZUTXOs, which makes wallets faster and also protects against dusting attacks.

## Sprout

The original generation of shielded adddresses (zaddrs) which had many bugs, and were replaced with a new implementation that did not suffer
from inflation attacks.
